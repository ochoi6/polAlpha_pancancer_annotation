# Pan-cancer and cell-type specific characterization of polymerase alpha using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq profiling 


## Data access



## Software 

### Single-cell RNA seq

Analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.1) and Python (version 3.10.9). 

In Python, we used the packages such as Scanpy (v.1.9.5), Pandas (v.2.0.0), Conda (v.4.11.0), NumPy (v.1.24.2), and Scipy (v.1.10.1) for data analysis.

In R, we used ggplot2 ()

The R package ComplexHeatmap (v.2.11.1) was employed to generate heat maps, while visualization was facilitated using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5), ggpubr (v.0.6.0), and ggrepel (v.0.9.2) R packages.

### Bulk RNA seq

Differences between the low and high YchrS group outcomes was evaluated using log-rank or Cox statistics and visualized using Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves, as implemented in the survminer package in R software
